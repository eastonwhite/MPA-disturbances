# Catastrophes, connectivity, and Allee effects in the design of marine reserve networks

This repository contains R markdown files and scripts to produce the figures and supplementary material for a paper currently in review. The paper is available as a preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/750448v1

The R markdown files run simulations and create figures. Therefore, it takes a long time (several days on a typical laptop) to compile the file. Please contact Easton White (eastonrwhite@gmail.com) with any concerns or feedback.
